<h1 align="center"> Hello 👋, I'm Pasindu Aluthwalahewa</h1>
<!-- <h3 align="center">Trainee Software Engineer at 99x</h3> -->

I'm a passionate software engineer focused on building scalable, intelligent, and cloud-ready applications that merge full-stack development with AI-driven innovation.

My core tech stack includes .NET, React, and Agentic AI, with hands-on experience in C#, Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and databases like MS SQL and MongoDB. I design and develop robust applications using React and Angular on the frontend, and .NET, Spring Boot, and FastAPI on the backend.

⚙️ I’m also experienced in containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes, with practical expertise in deploying and managing applications on Azure and AWS.

🤖 My current focus is on Agentic AI systems, where I’m an engineer of xians.ai - an open-source Agentic AI platform for creating, deploying, and managing intelligent workflows. I work with frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and LLMs to build autonomous, scalable AI solutions that seamlessly integrate into modern software to enhance user experiences and decision-making.

🚀 As an open-source advocate, I love sharing knowledge, contributing to community-driven projects, and collaborating with developers around the world to push the boundaries of what technology can do.

🌟 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together!
